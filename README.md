# BlackJack
This game is a simulation between the dealer and the player(you). This program is coded solely using Java.

Black Jack is a card game between the dealer and the player to get a total score closest to 21. The one with the highest score without busting is the winner. 

At the start of the game, the dealer's cards will be face up and the user gets 2 cards facing up. Depending of the value of those cards, the user decides if they want to hit or stay. This games follows the standard rules of black jack(there are no changes to play this one).  I created interactable buttons that the user can choose whether they decide to hit(another card will generate) or stay(the total score is the ending score for the player).

Coding this game helped me learn the sequencing of this program as well as applying loops, random generation and variables to better iterate a virtual simulation that acts as a real game that would be played in real life.
